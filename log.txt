All modules have been implemented, main class need to be finalized.
data_manage.py can be renamed as i/o.py
Currently, the whole i/o flow is as followed:
    1. Read molecule from xyz file.
    2. Dump the molecule information to the format which the qc_engine requires.
    3. Read/get the qc results and dump to the format which the ml_engine requires.
    4. Use ml_engine output for optimization with ASE optimizer. Read/get molecule 
    information to ASE Atom object.
    5. Dump the optimized geometry to the initial xyz file.(append)
    6. Go back to step 1 and start the loop.

To be done:
The all i/o operation can be wrapped in one file.

Need to be done:
1. Add selecting function for pbc or nopbc in ML_engine class and Data class
2. Modify data preparation part in Data class
